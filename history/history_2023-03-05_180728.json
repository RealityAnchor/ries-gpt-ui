Check that the browser recognizes your extension: Go to `about:debugging` and verify that your extension is listed.\n\n2. Inspect the background script: Open the background script in the debugger and verify that it executes correctly by adding a `console.log()` statement to the top of the script. It should execute when Firefox starts up.\n\n3. Inspect the popup script: Open the popup script in the debugger and verify that it executes correctly by adding a `console.log()` statement to the top of the script. It should execute when the popup is displayed.\n\n4. Verify that bookmarks are being saved: Open the developer tools (F12) when the extension is running and navigate to Storage > Local Storage > file://{your-extension-id}/. Verify that your bookmarks are being saved correctly.\n\n5. Verify that the popup script executes correctly: When you click the \"Shuffle!\" button in the popup, `selectRandomBookmark()` should execute and create a new tab with a randomly selected bookmark. To debug this, add `console.log()` statements throughout the function and verify that they execute in the correct order.\n\nRegarding your specific questions about `content.js`, based on the code you've provided, it looks like you don't need a `content.js` file at this time. If you do want to use one, you would need to decide what functionality you want it to provide and create a new file with that content.

To solve this issue, you need to modify your code to include the JavaScript file in your extension bundle and reference it from there.\n\nTo do this, you should create a file called `script.js` (or any other name you choose) and include your `selectRandomBookmark()` function in that file:\n\n```\nfunction selectRandomBookmark() {\n  browser.storage.local.get('bookmarks')\n    .then(result => {\n      let bookmarks = result.bookmarks;\n      let totalWeight = 0;\n      bookmarks.forEach(bookmark => {\n        totalWeight += bookmark.weight;\n      });\n      let randomWeight = Math.random() * totalWeight;\n      for (let i = 0; i < bookmarks.length; i++) {\n        randomWeight -= bookmarks[i].weight;\n        if (randomWeight <= 0) {\n          browser.tabs.create({url: bookmarks[i].url, active: true});\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThen, update your `popup.html` file to include the new file and reference your function from there:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Bookmark Shuffler</title>\n    <style>\n      body {\n        width: 120px;\n        height: 60px;\n        background: #000;\n        color: #975;\n      }\n\n      #bookmarks div {\n        font-size: 12px;\n        margin-top: 5px;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <button onclick=\"selectRandomBookmark()\">Shuffle!</button>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"popup.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFinally, update your `popup.js` file to remove the inline code:\n\n```\nfunction selectRandomBookmark() {\n  console.log('b')\n  selectRandomBookmarkFromStorage();\n}\n\nfunction selectRandomBookmarkFromStorage() {\n  browser.storage.local.get('bookmarks')\n    .then(result => {\n      let bookmarks = result.bookmarks;\n      let totalWeight = 0;\n      bookmarks.forEach(bookmark => {\n        totalWeight += bookmark.weight;\n      });\n      let randomWeight = Math.random() * totalWeight;\n      for (let i = 0; i < bookmarks.length; i++) {\n        randomWeight -= bookmarks[i].weight;\n        if (randomWeight <= 0) {\n          browser.tabs.create({url: bookmarks[i].url, active: true});\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n    });\n}\n```\n\nNow you have separated the JavaScript code from the HTML code, and your extension should work correctly without throwing the CSP error.\n\nAs for storing the code locally, it's perfectly okay to distribute your extension with the JavaScript code included in your extension bundle. This is actually the recommended approach."}]
