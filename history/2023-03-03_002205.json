Right-click on the selected text and choose \"Copy Text Without Formatting\" or a similar option (the wording may vary depending on the PDF editor you're using).\n4. Open a text editor or word processor and paste the copied text.\n5. Check to make sure that the text does not have any unnatural line breaks.\n\nIf this method doesn't work, you can try converting the PDF to a Word document using an online converter or software, and then copy the text from the Word document."}, {"role": "user", "content": "regex for EOL w/o punctuation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The following regex pattern can be used to match the end of a line that is not followed by punctuation:\n\n```\n(\\n)[^\\w\\s]\n```\n\nThis pattern looks for a newline character (`\\n`) that is immediately followed by a character that is not a word character (`\\w`) or whitespace (`\\s`).

The `.` matches any character (except newline), and the `\\` is used to escape the following character in the pattern, in this case a period.

The `.` within the square brackets represents a period, which matches a literal period character. The `\\n` represents a newline character. The `?` and `!` each represent a literal question mark and exclamation mark respectively.\n\nSo together, `[^.\\n?!]` matches any character that is not a period, newline, question mark, or exclamation mark.\n\nFor example, the regex pattern `[^.\\n?!]+` will match one or more non-punctuation characters in sequence, as it repeats the character class one or more times.

Thus, when you replace a match with `\\1`, it not only removes the newline characters `\\r\\n`, but also the character matched by the previous group.\n\nTo remove all the newlines without removing the last character, you can use the following regex pattern with a replacement string that contains just the captured group:\n\nFind: `[a-z]\\r\\n`\nReplace with: `$0` or `\\0`\n\nThis regex matches a single lowercase letter followed by a Windows-style newline (`\\r\\n`). The `$0` or `\\0` replacement string refers to the entire matched string (i.e., the letter and the newline), so replacing it with itself effectively removes only the newline characters.\n\nMake sure to enable the \"Multiline\" option if you are using this regex on a multi-line string, so that `$` matches the end of each line rather than the end of the entire string."}]
