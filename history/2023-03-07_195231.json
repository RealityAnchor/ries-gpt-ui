Here is an updated version of the code that reads the contents of the JSON files and returns a list of file objects:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\n\ndef load_json_files(self, directory):\n    file_objects = []\n    for file in os.listdir(directory):\n        if file.endswith(\".json\"):\n            with open(os.path.join(directory, file), \"r\") as f:\n                file_objects.append(json.load(f))\n    return file_objects\n```\n\nIn this updated code, we first create an empty list called `file_objects` to store the file objects. We then iterate over the list of files in the specified directory using a for loop. For each file, we check if the filename ends with \".json\". If it does, we then use `open()` with the filename to open the file in read mode, and then use `json.load()` to parse the JSON data from the file into a Python object. Finally, we append the resulting object to the `file_objects` list.\n\nThis modified code returns a list of file objects, where each object corresponds to a JSON file in the specified directory."}]
