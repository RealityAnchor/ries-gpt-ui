Every morning, she would wake up early and bake fresh muffins, and then distribute them to the children in her neighborhood.\n\nOne day, while she was walking to the park to hand out the muffins, she saw a little girl crying on the street. The girl's ice cream had fallen on the ground, and she was very upset. Lily sat down beside her, held her hand and consoled her. She then went back to her house, baked a fresh batch of cookies, and brought them back to the little girl.\n\nFrom that day on, the little girl started visiting Lily every day after school. Together they would bake cookies and muffins, play board games, and talk about their day. They soon became best friends, and their bond became an inspiration for everyone in the town.\n\nLily's kind gesture had not only brightened up the little girl's day but had also brought two generations closer. People in the town now knew each other better, and everyone started spreading kindness and joy just like Lily did."}]
