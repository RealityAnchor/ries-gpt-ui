You can then use additional options to adjust the widget properties and its packing behavior.\n\nHere is an example of how the pack() method can be used:\n\n```\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\nlbl1 = tk.Label(root, text=\"Hello\")\nlbl1.pack(side='left')\n\nlbl2 = tk.Label(root, text=\"World\")\nlbl2.pack(side='right')\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, two label widgets \"Hello\" and \"World\" are created and positioned in the left and right sides of the parent window using the pack() method."}, {"role": "user", "content": "write tkinter program to show all the different ways of packing and displaying widgets. use 1px #975 borders to clearly demarcate where each one starts/ends, and use padx=1, pady=1 for everything\n\n#000 bg, #975 foreground"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is an example program that demonstrates different ways of packing and displaying widgets in Tkinter while also using borders and paddings:\n\n```\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Set background and foreground colors\nroot.configure(bg='#000')\nfg_color = '#975'\n\n# Create frames\nframe_top = tk.Frame(root, bg=fg_color, borderwidth=1, relief='solid')\nframe_top.pack(side='top', fill='x', padx=1, pady=1)\n\nframe_left = tk.Frame(root, bg=fg_color, borderwidth=1, relief='solid')\nframe_left.pack(side='left', fill='y', padx=1, pady=1)\n\nframe_center = tk.Frame(root, bg=fg_color, borderwidth=1, relief='solid')\nframe_center.pack(side='left', fill='both', expand=True, padx=1, pady=1)\n\nframe_right = tk.Frame(root, bg=fg_color, borderwidth=1, relief='solid')\nframe_right.pack(side='left', fill='both', expand=True, padx=1, pady=1)\n\nframe_bottom = tk.Frame(root, bg=fg_color, borderwidth=1, relief='solid')\nframe_bottom.pack(side='bottom', fill='x', padx=1, pady=1)\n\n# Create labels\nlabel1 = tk.Label(frame_top, text='Top Frame', bg=fg_color)\nlabel1.pack(padx=1, pady=1)\n\nlabel2 = tk.Label(frame_left, text='Left Frame', bg=fg_color)\nlabel2.pack(padx=1, pady=1)\n\nlabel3 = tk.Label(frame_center, text='Center Frame', bg=fg_color)\nlabel3.pack(padx=1, pady=1)\n\nlabel4 = tk.Label(frame_right, text='Right Frame', bg=fg_color)\nlabel4.pack(padx=1, pady=1)\n\nlabel5 = tk.Label(frame_bottom, text='Bottom Frame', bg=fg_color)\nlabel5.pack(padx=1, pady=1)\n\n# Create button\nbutton = tk.Button(root, text='Button', bd=1, bg=fg_color, activebackground=fg_color, fg='#fff')\nbutton.pack(fill='x', padx=1, pady=1)\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this program, we use five frames to demonstrate different packing options:\n\n- The 'top' frame is packed at the top of the parent widget, and is set to fill in the x direction.
