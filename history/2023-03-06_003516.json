It is believed to be the age of darkness and ignorance, characterized by moral and social decay, widespread suffering, and a general decline in spirituality. According to Hindu scriptures, Kali-yuga is marked by the loss of virtuous principles and the prevalence of greed, dishonesty, and violence. It is said to have started around 5,000 years ago and will last for a total of 432,000 years, with only 5,000 years having passed so far. Despite the challenges of Kali-yuga, it is also seen as an opportunity for personal growth and spiritual elevation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "other 3 cycles"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other three cycles in the Hindu cosmology of Yugas are:\n\n1. Satya Yuga: Also known as the Golden Age, it is believed to be the age of truth and perfection, characterized by righteousness, virtue, and spirituality. It is said to have lasted for 1,728,000 years, and people lived in peace and harmony, following a simple and natural way of life.\n\n2. Treta Yuga: This is the second cycle, also known as the Silver Age, characterized by a reduction in spirituality and virtue. It is said to have lasted for 1,296,000 years, and it is during this period that the concept of sacrifice was introduced, along with societal hierarchy.\n\n3. Dwapara Yuga: The third cycle, also known as the Bronze Age, witnessed an even further decline in spirituality and virtue. It is said to have lasted for 864,000 years, and it is during this period that the great epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana were composed, marked by wars and conflicts.\n\nEach Yuga is said to have a shorter lifespan than the previous one, indicating a gradual decline in human values and morality. It is believed that the current age of Kali Yuga started after the end of Dwapara Yuga, marking the final phase of the cycle of Yugas."}, {"role": "user", "content": "how accurate is this framing of left/right hemisphere in terms of self deception?\n\nThe right hemisphere kicks you in the butt, reorients you, and says \"look, you're going too far, it's time to give up this delusion, return to reality, and start from scratch\". There is a dynamic equilibrium between extreme delusion and extreme doubt. On the one hand, you can believe you are Napoleon and try to take over the world. On the other, life is gloomy. People who are depressed are more realistic. To carry on your daily life, you must engage in small amount of denial all the time, to let you proceed towards your goal without constantly changing your mind, to confer stability onto behaviour."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The framing of the left and right hemisphere in terms of self-deception is a popular idea and has been explored in various fields, including psychology and neuroscience. While some research has supported the idea that the left hemisphere tends to be more analytical and logical, while the right hemisphere is more intuitive and creative, this specific claim about self-deception is not supported by strong empirical evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that depression leads to more realistic thinking is a controversial topic in the field of psychology. While it is true that some individuals with depression may have a more negative outlook on life, it is not necessarily true that their thinking is more accurate or realistic. Clinical depression can lead to distorted thinking patterns and irrational beliefs, which can contribute to the maintenance of depressive symptoms.\n\nTherefore, while the idea of the left and right hemisphere playing different cognitive roles is an interesting one, it is important to be cautious about making blanket statements about self-deception and realistic thinking without sufficient empirical evidence to support them."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The Su\u015brutasa\u1e43hit\u0101"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Su\u015brutasa\u1e43hit\u0101 is an ancient Sanskrit text in the tradition of Ayurveda, which is the traditional Hindu system of medicine.
