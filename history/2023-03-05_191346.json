Attractors play an essential role in chaos theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Three prominent types of attractors are:\n- Point attractor: in which the system evolves toward a single point in phase space.\n- Limit cycle attractor: in which the system converges toward a periodic orbit in phase space.\n- Strange attractor: in which the system evolves toward a complex, fractal set of points in phase space, which has a \"strange\" geometry that never repeats itself."}, {"role": "user", "content": "expand on strange attractors"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strange attractors are a type of mathematical attractor that exhibit a self-similar shape and a non-integer dimensionality. They can arise in nonlinear dynamical systems, such as those described by chaotic or dense flows. These systems are characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, meaning that small variations in starting conditions for the system can lead to vastly different outcomes. \n\nThe set of points that constitute a strange attractor is fractal in nature, which means it has self-similar properties, regardless of the scale on which it is viewed. Fractals have non-integer (or fractal) dimensionality, which means that their complexity can exceed the dimensionality of the space they occupy. Strange attractors also have a sensitivity to initial conditions which is even more pronounced than that of simpler chaotic systems.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a strange attractor is the Lorenz attractor, which was discovered by mathematician Edward Lorenz in the 1960s. The Lorenz attractor is a three-dimensional system that displays a butterfly-shaped attractor in phase space, with the wings of the butterfly oscillating in a periodic manner, while the body of the butterfly evolves chaotically.\n\nStrange attractors have applications in fields such as meteorology, fluid dynamics, and computer science. They are important for understanding complex systems that exhibit emergent behavior, such as the way groups of individuals interact in social networks. The study of strange attractors has helped researchers to identify patterns in complex systems that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, and it continues to be an active area of research."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Integers in the interval [0,20) why mix brackets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When defining an interval in mathematics, brackets and parentheses have different meanings. In general:\n- Square brackets, \"[ ]\", mean that the endpoint is included in the interval, i.e., the interval is closed on that endpoint.\n- Parentheses, \"( )\", mean that the endpoint is excluded from the interval, i.e., the interval is open on that endpoint.\n\nSo, if we want to specify the set of integers in the interval [0, 20), this would include all integers from 0 up to (but not including) 20. Because the number 0 is included in the interval, we use a square bracket; because the number 20 is excluded from the interval, we use a parenthesis.\n\nUsing mixed brackets, like in [0, 20), can be somewhat confusing and potentially ambiguous, so it is generally recommended to use consistent brackets when specifying intervals in mathematics."}, {"role": "user", "content": "alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789&-,'./!\"\n\n??"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's unclear what you're asking for with the given input of `alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789&-,'./!\"??`.
