These apps can be developed by third-party developers or created in-house. Shopify apps are designed to increase the functionality of Shopify stores and help businesses streamline their processes, automate tasks, and improve their customer experience.\n\nIn contrast, functions are blocks of code within an app or a platform that perform specific tasks. Functions are typically pre-built and included within the app or platform, and they can be called upon to carry out specific tasks without needing to be developed from scratch.\n\nIf you want to make API calls to GPT-3 through Shopify, creating a Shopify app that integrates with GPT-3 would be the appropriate approach. However, this may require additional technical expertise and development resources, as you would need to build a custom app that can communicate with the GPT-3 API.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider using a pre-built integration platform like Zapier or Integromat to connect Shopify with GPT-3. These platforms allow you to create \"Zaps\" or \"Scenarios\" that automate tasks between two or more apps, including Shopify and GPT-3.\n\nAnother option is to use a Shopify app that already integrates with GPT-3 or with other natural language processing (NLP) tools. A few examples of such apps are Content AI, Persado, and Neuralyzer. These apps use AI and machine learning to generate product descriptions, marketing copy, and other content for your Shopify store, without requiring any coding or technical knowledge.\n\nIn summary, creating a custom Shopify app that integrates with GPT-3 is one option, but there are also pre-built integration platforms and Shopify apps that can accomplish similar goals without requiring custom development. The best approach depends on your specific needs and technical capabilities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "in py tkinter, how to set up elements so that one spans the page horizontally, and two are below and adjacent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To set up elements in PyTkinter so that one spans the page horizontally and two are below and adjacent, you can use the Grid geometry manager.\n\nHere is an example code:\n\n```\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Set up the first element that spans the page horizontally\nelement1 = tk.Label(root, text=\"Element 1\")\nelement1.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2, sticky=\"EW\")\n\n# Set up the second element that is below and to the left of the first element\nelement2 = tk.Label(root, text=\"Element 2\")\nelement2.grid(row=1, column=0)\n\n# Set up the third element that is below and to the right of the first element\nelement3 = tk.Label(root, text=\"Element 3\")\nelement3.grid(row=1, column=1)\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `grid()` method to position the elements. The first element, `element1`, spans two columns using the `columnspan` parameter and uses the `sticky` parameter to make it fill the entire horizontal space (`\"EW\"` means East-West). The second and third elements, `element2` and `element3`, are placed below and adjacent to `element1` by setting their `row` and `column` parameters accordingly.\n\nYou can adjust the positions and sizing of the elements by changing their `row` and `column` parameters and using the `sticky` parameter to specify how they should align within their cells."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much do professional software/web developers accomplish in a workday?

Mix the dried or finely chopped fresh oregano directly into the dough before kneading. This ensures that the flavor is evenly distributed throughout the bread.\n\n2. If using larger pieces of fresh oregano, you can sprinkle them over the dough during the shaping process, before the final proof. This will distribute the herbs more unevenly, but can give you nice flecks of herb visible within the bread.\n\nWhen adding oregano, or any other herbs, to bread dough, it's generally best to mix them in with the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients. This ensures that the herbs are evenly distributed throughout the dough.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider drying fresh oregano before using it in bread dough. Simply hang the herb upside down in a dry place for a few days until the leaves are brittle, then crumble them into the bread dough. Using dry herbs in bread dough is often easier to work with and gives a more consistent result.\n\nWhen making bread with herbs, it's always a good idea to start with a small amount and add more as needed. You don't want to overpower the other flavors, but you also want to make sure that the herbs are noticeable. Add a little at a time until you find the right balance for your tastes.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that some herbs, such as basil or garlic, can affect the rising of the bread. Oregano is generally safe to use in bread dough as it doesn't contain enzymes that can disrupt the yeast fermentation, so you shouldn't need to make any adjustments to the recipe.

It's the time when the shaped dough is allowed to rise one final time, just before it goes into the oven.\n\nAfter the dough has been kneaded and left to rise once, it is typically shaped into loaves or rolls and placed in a baking dish or on a baking sheet. This is when the final proofing begins. The dough is usually covered and left to rise again in a warm, draft-free place until it has nearly doubled in size. For most bread recipes, the final proofing time is around 30-60 minutes, but it can vary depending on the recipe and the temperature of your kitchen.\n\nDuring the final proof, yeast is still producing carbon dioxide as it feeds on sugar in the dough. The carbon dioxide causes the dough to expand and become more porous, which creates the light and airy texture that is characteristic of bread. The final proof is crucial to developing the structure and flavor of the bread, and it's important not to rush it or let it go too long.\n\nOnce the dough has gone through the final proof, it's time to bake the bread.

It's recommended to proof the dough separately in a bowl or proofing basket, covered with a damp cloth, while the cast iron pan and the oven preheat.\n\nIf you're worried about the dough drying out during the final proofing, you can lightly oil the surface of the dough or cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Just make sure the dough is not in direct contact with the moist covering as it can lead to a \"sticky\" crust. \n\nDuring the final proof, it's important to allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free place to ensure even rising. The optimal temperature for the final proof is between 75-80\u00b0F (24-27\u00b0C).

A sourdough starter is a natural leavening agent that's made by fermenting flour and water over time, and it doesn't require any additional commercial yeast to rise. Sourdough breads typically have a longer fermentation time compared to breads made with commercial yeast, and the flavor is often more complex and tangy.\n\nWith a sourdough starter, you can typically proof the dough for several hours to overnight at room temperature, or you can refrigerate the dough and proof it over a period of several days. Some artisan bakers may even proof their sourdough bread for several days in a cool place (such as a refrigerator or a cool basement) to develop a deep flavor and texture.\n\nHowever, with commercial yeast, the longest possible proofing time will depend on the recipe and the conditions in your kitchen. In general, a proofing time of 8-12 hours at room temperature is the upper limit for most bread recipes using minimal amounts of yeast.

The yeast and bacteria also produce organic acids and other flavor compounds that give the bread a deeper, more complex flavor and aroma.\n\nAdditionally, the cold temperature of the refrigerator can also lead to a slightly denser, chewier texture in the bread, as the gluten strands have more time to develop and strengthen over the longer fermentation period.\n\nThat being said, the multiday fridge proofing method requires more planning and preparation, as you'll need to shape the dough before placing it in the refrigerator and then let it come to room temperature before baking.

As the dough is kneaded or mixed, this network becomes stronger and more organized, resulting in a stretchy, elastic texture that gives bread its distinctive chewiness.\n\nGluten strands are important in bread-making because they give the dough the ability to trap carbon dioxide released by the yeast, allowing the bread to rise and become light and airy.
