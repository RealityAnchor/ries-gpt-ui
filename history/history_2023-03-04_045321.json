Identify the key points and main ideas of the conversation, and focus on those. \n2. Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize the information and make it easier to read. \n3. Use concise, clear language and avoid unnecessary details or filler words/phrases. \n4. If necessary, break up the conversation into smaller chunks and summarize them separately. \n5. Consider using headings or section titles to make it easier to navigate the information. \n6. Use quotes or paraphrases to capture the essence of what was said in the conversation, but don't overdo it. \n7. Avoid repeating information unnecessarily, and make sure everything you include is relevant and contributes to the overall meaning. \n8. If you have to leave out any important or relevant details, make sure to note that they were omitted for brevity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "how to do it programmatically"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are some steps to programmatically summarize/compress/slice long conversations for GPT-3:\n\n1. Preprocess the text data to remove any extraneous or irrelevant information. This could include removing headers/footers, removing duplicated content, and removing filler words or phrases.\n\n2. Use a natural language processing (NLP) library such as NLTK or Spacy to extract key phrases, named entities, and summary sentences from the text.\n\n3. Use text summarization algorithms such as TextRank, LSA, or GPT-3 itself to generate a summary of the conversation. These algorithms use statistical or machine learning techniques to identify the most important sentences or phrases in the text and combine them into a summary.\n\n4. If necessary, break up the summary into smaller chunks to fit within the input/output limits of GPT-3. \n\n5. Finally, pass the summarized text to GPT-3 for further processing. \n\nImplementing these steps in a program will require some basic scripting skills and familiarity with NLP libraries and text summarization techniques. However, there are also many open-source tools and libraries available that can help simplify the process."}]
