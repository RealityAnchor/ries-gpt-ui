Clone the repository onto your local machine using the git clone command. This copies the repository onto your local machine, allowing you to make changes.\n\n3. Create a branch for your changes using the git branch command. This allows you to work on features or issues without impacting the main codebase.\n\n4. Make changes to your code and commit them using git commit. This stages your changes and adds a commit message describing the changes.\n\n5. Push your changes to your GitHub repository using the git push command.\n\n6. Create a pull request to merge your changes with the main codebase. This involves submitting a request to merge your branch with the main branch on GitHub, where it can be reviewed and approved by collaborators.\n\n7. Review and merge the pull request. Collaborators can review the changes you made, and approve or suggest further changes before merging the changes with the main codebase.\n\nIt\u2019s important to communicate frequently with other collaborators on the project and avoid conflicts by keeping your code up-to-date with the main codebase. This ensures that your changes don\u2019t conflict with those made by other developers on the project.

Here are the steps to secure your API calls with HTTPS:\n\nNode.js (using Axios):\n1. Install Axios using npm: `npm install axios`\n2. Import Axios into your script: `const axios = require('axios').default`\n3. Use the `axios.create()` function to create an instance of Axios with the `httpsAgent` option set to a new `https.Agent()` object, which will ensure that requests are sent over HTTPS: \n```javascript\nconst https = require('https');\nconst agent = new https.Agent({\n  rejectUnauthorized: true\n});    \nconst axiosInstance = axios.create({\n  httpsAgent: agent\n});\n```\n4. Use the Axios instance to make requests instead of using the `axios` function directly: `axiosInstance.get(\u2018https://example.com/api/endpoint\u2019);`\n\nPython (using Requests):\n1. Install Requests using pip: `pip install requests`\n2. Import Requests into your script: `import requests`\n3. Use the `get` or `post` function to send your API request with the `verify` parameter set to true. This will ensure that the request is sent over HTTPS and that the certificate is verified:\n```python\nresponse = requests.get('https://example.com/api/endpoint', verify=True)\n```\n4. You can also set a custom certificate authority (CA) bundle by specifying the path to the CA bundle file. For example:\n```python\nresponse = requests.get('https://example.com/api/endpoint', verify='/path/to/ca-bundle.crt')\n```\nMake sure to replace 'https://example.com/api/endpoint' with your actual API endpoint.\n\nBy using these libraries and setting the appropriate options, you can ensure that your API calls are sent securely over HTTPS."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is graffiti artist banksy's official intermediary website to sell physical copies of his art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Banksy, the anonymous England-based street artist, does not have an official intermediary website for selling physical copies of his art.

The ancient Egyptians are credited with making the first leavened bread, which was achieved by allowing dough to rest and naturally ferment.\n\nOver time, bread became an essential staple food in many cultures around the world, and different types of bread were developed based on regional ingredients and cooking techniques. In Ancient Rome, for example, bread was made with high-quality wheat flour and baked in large-scale bakeries. The French developed distinctive techniques for making crusty baguettes, while the Caribbean region has its own unique variation of bread made from cassava root.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, bread baking became a highly skilled profession, and bakers formed guilds to protect their trade secrets and ensure the quality of their products. In the 19th and 20th centuries, bread production became increasingly industrialized, and large bakeries opened in urban areas to supply bread to growing populations.\n\nToday, bread is a globally popular food that is enjoyed in a wide variety of forms, from slices of plain white bread to artisanal loaves made from ancient grains or sourdough starters.
