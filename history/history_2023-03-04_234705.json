With asyncio, multiple tasks are scheduled cooperatively within a single thread, allowing us to achieve high concurrency without the overhead of multiple threads. It is particularly useful for I/O bound operations such as network-bound operations or working with files.\n\nMultithreading, on the other hand, is a concurrent programming model that uses multiple threads to execute different parts of the program simultaneously. Each thread runs concurrently and operates independently. It is particularly useful for CPU-bound operations such as calculations and computations.\n\nIn general, if your program involves a lot of I/O operations or network-bound tasks, then you should use async-await (asyncio). On the other hand, if your program involves a lot of CPU-intensive operations, then multithreading would be a better choice. However, the actual choice between the two models ultimately depends on the precise requirements of your application."}]
