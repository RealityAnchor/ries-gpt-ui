This is because, when you call a method on an object, Python automatically passes the object instance as the first argument. This `self` parameter refers to the current instance of the class.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\nclass MyClass:\n    def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):\n        # code that uses arg1 and arg2\n```\n\nIn the above example, `my_method` is defined with `self` as the first parameter. When you create an instance of this class and call its method like this:\n\n```\nmy_object = MyClass()\nmy_object.my_method(\"argument 1\", \"argument 2\")\n```\n\nPython will automatically pass `my_object` as the first argument to `my_method`. This allows the method to access and modify the instance variables of `my_object`.\n\nSo yes, you need to include `self` as the first parameter in a method definition in Python."}]
