It is easy to generate and read, and is commonly used for spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel. \n\nJSON, on the other hand, stores data in a hierarchical or nested structure that uses key-value pairs. It is a lightweight format that is human-readable and easy to understand. It is commonly used for web applications where data needs to be transmitted between the front-end and back-end. \n\nWhile both formats have their own advantages, choosing one over the other depends on the nature of the data being exchanged, the system requirements, and integration with other systems.
