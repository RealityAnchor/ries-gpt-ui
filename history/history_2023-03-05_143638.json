The distance from the goal, the speed of the attacking player, and the position of the goalkeeper are just a few of the variables that come into play. Additionally, different models may give different values depending on the methodology and assumptions made.\n\nThat being said, based on various xG models and analyses, a 1v1 breakaway against a keeper is generally considered to be one of the highest-quality scoring opportunities in soccer, with typical xG values ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 or even higher. However, the actual xG value will depend on the specific circumstances of the situation, such as the skill level of the players involved, the angle of attack, and the timing of the shot. Therefore, it is difficult to give a precise estimate, but a range of 0.5 to 0.9 might be reasonable, with a confidence level of around 70-80%."}]
