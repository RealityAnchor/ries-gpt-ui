Make sure that all the files are saved and located in the correct directories. In shuffler.html, make sure that the path to shuffler.js is correct.

By adding these permissions to your manifest.json file, you're telling Firefox that your extension needs access to web pages to function correctly.\n\nIn terms of removing extraneous lines, you can remove the entire `browser_action` section in the manifest.json file since it's only used in Chrome extensions. Also, in shuffler.js, you should replace `chrome.tabs.create({url: bookmarks[i].url});` with `browser.tabs.create({url: bookmarks[i].url, active: true});` since `chrome.tabs` is a Chrome-specific API.\n\nHere's the modified manifest.json file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"Shuffler\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Loads bookmark at random from bookmarks.json into a new tab\",\n  \"permissions\": [\"http://*/*\", \"https://*/*\"],\n  \"background\": {\n    \"scripts\": [\"shuffler.js\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's the modified shuffler.js file:\n\n```\nfunction selectRandomBookmark() \n{\n  fetch(\"bookmarks.json\")\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(bookmarks => \n    {\n      let totalWeight = 0;\n      bookmarks.forEach(bookmark => \n      {\n        totalWeight += bookmark.weight;\n      });\n      let randomWeight = Math.random() * totalWeight;\n      for (let i = 0; i < bookmarks.length; i++) \n      {\n        randomWeight -= bookmarks[i].weight;\n        if (randomWeight <= 0) {\n          browser.tabs.create({url: bookmarks[i].url, active: true});\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n    });\n}\n```\n\nI hope this helps!

This is because you're trying to load the file using the `fetch` method from a local file system (`file:`) or a different origin from where the extension is being served.\n\nTo bypass this issue, you can store the bookmarks data locally within the extension. One way to do this is to use the `storage` API provided by Firefox, which allows you to store data locally within the extension. Here's how you can modify your `shuffler.js` file to load the bookmarks data from `storage` instead of the `fetch` method:\n\n```\nfunction selectRandomBookmark() {\n  browser.storage.local.get('bookmarks')\n    .then(result => {\n      let bookmarks = result.bookmarks;\n      let totalWeight = 0;\n      bookmarks.forEach(bookmark => {\n        totalWeight += bookmark.weight;\n      });\n      let randomWeight = Math.random() * totalWeight;\n      for (let i = 0; i < bookmarks.length; i++) {\n        randomWeight -= bookmarks[i].weight;\n        if (randomWeight <= 0) {\n          browser.tabs.create({url: bookmarks[i].url, active: true});\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n    });\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `storage` API is used to retrieve the bookmarks data from local storage. Note that you'll need to store the bookmarks data in `storage` somewhere within your extension. You can do this by adding the following code to your `mainfest.json` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"Shuffler\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Loads bookmark at random from bookmarks.json into a new tab\",\n  \"permissions\": [\"http://*/*\", \"https://*/*\", \"storage\"],\n  \"background\": {\n    \"scripts\": [\"shuffler.js\"]\n  },\n\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"],\n      \"js\": [\"content.js\"]\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"browser_action\": {\n    \"default_title\": \"Bookmark Shuffler\",\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\",\n    \"default_icon\": {\n      \"16\": \"icons/16.png\",\n      \"32\": \"icons/32.png\",\n      \"48\": \"icons/48.png\",\n      \"128\": \"icons/128.png\"\n    }\n  },\n\n  \"icons\": {\n    \"16\": \"icons/16.png\",\n    \"32\": \"icons/32.png\",\n    \"48\": \"icons/48.png\",\n    \"128\": \"icons/128.png\"\n  },\n\n  \"web_accessible_resources\": [\n    \"shuffler.js\"\n  ],\n\n  \"background\": {\n    \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n    \"persistent\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then store the bookmarks data in `storage` using this code (for example, in a `background.js` file):\n\n```\nbrowser.storage.local.set({\n  bookmarks: [\n    {\"url\":\"https://i.imgur.com/1Cq0eHR.png\", \"weight\":1},\n    {\"url\":\"https://i.imgur.com/jA2ELFW.jpg\", \"weight\":3}\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nI hope that helps!

The maximum size varies depending on the type of storage you're using (`local`, `sync`, or `managed`) and the user's browser settings.\n\nFor `local` storage, the maximum size is typically around 5-10MB, but could be less depending on the user's settings. `sync` storage has a smaller limit (often less than 100KB) since it's synchronized across devices.\n\nTo avoid hitting the storage limit, it's a good idea to keep the amount of data you store in `storage` to a minimum. For example, you could store the bookmarks data in a separate file or database and only load the relevant data into `storage` when the extension is launched. Alternatively, you could consider using a server-side solution for storing the bookmarks data instead of relying on client-side storage.\n\nIf you do exceed the storage limit, data may be deleted or the extension may stop working.

If your `shuffler.js` file is already separate and you're still seeing a CSP error, it's possible that the error is caused by other inline scripts on the page or by a CSP policy set by the extension itself.\n\nTo check if an extension is enforcing a CSP policy, you can look at the `Content-Security-Policy` header in the network tab of the Developer Tools in Firefox. This header can be set by the browser or by an extension to restrict what types of scripts and content can be loaded on the page.\n\nIf you find that an extension is enforcing a CSP policy that's causing the error, you may need to modify the policy by adding `unsafe-inline` to the `script-src` directive. However, this is not recommended since it can expose the page to security vulnerabilities.\n\nInstead, you should consider refactoring your code to avoid the use of inline scripts and to use JavaScript files that are loaded externally.
